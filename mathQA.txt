Supersymmetric Wilson Loops, Instantons, and Deformed ${\cal W}$-Algebras. (arXiv:1907.03838v2 [hep-th] UPDATED)

http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03838

<p>Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a simple Lie algebra. We study 1/2-BPS Wilson loops of
supersymmetric 5d $\mathfrak{g}$-type quiver gauge theories on a circle, in a
non-trivial instanton background. The Wilson loops are codimension 4 defects of
the gauge theory, and their interaction with self-dual instantons is captured
by a modified 1d ADHM quantum mechanics. We compute the partition function as
its Witten index. This index is a "$qq$-character" of a finite-dimensional
irreducible representation of the quantum affine algebra
$U_q(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$. Using gauge/vortex duality, we can understand the 5d
physics in 3d gauge theory terms. Namely, we reinterpret the 5d theory with
vortex flux from the point of view of the vortices themselves. This vortex
perspective has an advantage: it has yet another dual description in terms of
deformed $\mathfrak{g}$-type Toda Theory on a cylinder, in free field
formalism. We show that the gauge theory partition function is equal to a
chiral correlator of the deformed Toda Theory, with stress tensor and higher
spin operator insertions. We derive all the above results from type IIB string
theory, compactified on a resolved $ADE$ singularity times a cylinder with
punctures, with various branes wrapping the blown-up 2-cycles.

Vertex algebras of CohFT-type. (arXiv:1910.01658v2 [math.AG] UPDATED)

http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01658

<p>Representations of certain vertex algebras, here called of CohFT-type, can be
used to construct vector bundles of coinvariants and conformal blocks on moduli
spaces of stable curves [DGT2]. We show that such bundles define semisimple
cohomological field theories. As an application, we give an expression for
their total Chern character in terms of the fusion rules, following the
approach and computation in [MOPPZ] for bundles given by integrable modules
over affine Lie algebras. It follows that the Chern classes are tautological.
Examples and open problems are discussed.

A new invariant for finite dimensional Leibniz/Lie algebras. (arXiv:2006.00711v3 [math.RA] UPDATED)

http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00711

<p>For an $n$-dimensional Leibniz/Lie algebra $\mathfrak{h}$ over a field $k$ we
introduce a new invariant ${\mathcal A}(\mathfrak{h})$, called the
\emph{universal algebra} of $\mathfrak{h}$, as a quotient of the polynomial
algebra $k[X_{ij} \, | \, i, j = 1, \cdots, n]$ through an ideal generated by
$n^3$ polynomials. We prove that ${\mathcal A}(\mathfrak{h})$ admits a unique
bialgebra structure which makes it an initial object among all commutative
bialgebras coacting on $\mathfrak{h}$. The new object ${\mathcal A}
(\mathfrak{h})$ is the key tool in answering two open problems in Lie algebra
theory. First, we prove that the automorphism group ${\rm Aut}_{Lbz}
(\mathfrak{h})$ of $\mathfrak{h}$ is isomorphic to the group $U \bigl(
G({\mathcal A} (\mathfrak{h})^{\rm o} ) \bigl)$ of all invertible group-like
elements of the finite dual ${\mathcal A} (\mathfrak{h})^{\rm o}$. Secondly,
for an abelian group $G$, we show that there exists a bijection between the set
of all $G$-gradings on $\mathfrak{h}$ and the set of all bialgebra
homomorphisms ${\mathcal A} (\mathfrak{h}) \to k[G]$. Based on this, all
$G$-gradings on $\mathfrak{h}$ are explicitly classified and parameterized.
${\mathcal A} (\mathfrak{h})$ is also used to prove that there exists a
universal commutative Hopf algebra associated to any finite dimensional Leibniz
algebra $\mathfrak{h}$.
